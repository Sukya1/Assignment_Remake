# Group TO DO's 
1. Make the page Header (COMPLETE and Copied to each page and the corresponding CSS sheet) 
Bugs:
    1. hover effect causes flickering (fixed by adding a transition of 0s/none)
    2. post hoving effect shows a blue rectangle before returning to normal (fixed by adding a transition of 0s/none)
    3. contents of the drop box have not yet been modified (done using span elements and SVG image that floats right https://icons.getbootstrap.com/icons/arrow-up-right/)
    4. hover effect causes the icon to move right (fixed by removing padding from the hover effect/styling the margin instead)
    5. dropbox icon should be 2 lines instead of three (fixed by removing the navbar-toggler-icon class and replacing it with an appropriate image file found on the internet); cite used: https://icons8.com/icons/set/two-lines
    6. hover effect caused other elements beside it to move (fixed by adding a box shadow instead of a border: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36080415/css-hover-makes-other-elements-move)
    7. post click state leaves a border around dropdown (fixed by making the box shadow of btn focus none)
    8. close button is highlighted when clicked (same fix as 7)

2. Make the Page Footer

# Common Errors and fixes 
    1. add justify-content-end to the class to move things to the complete right of the screen
    2. <hr> is used for underlines 
    3. vw is for view width so it fits every screen
    4. Use z-index when layering items so the program knows which element to prioritize or how to layer them atop each other
    5. if the background color causes white overlay when layering (especially when layering on header icons eg. toggler), change the background color to transparent
