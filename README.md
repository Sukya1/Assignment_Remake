# Group TO DO's 
1. Make the page Header (COMPLETE and Copied to each page and the corresponding CSS sheet) 
Bugs:
    1. hover effect causes flickering (fixed by adding transition of 0s/none)
    2. post hoving effect shows a blue rectangle before returning to normal (fixed by adding transition of 0s/none)
    3. contents of the drop box have not yet been modified (done using span elements and svg image that foats right https://icons.getbootstrap.com/icons/arrow-up-right/)
    4. hover effect causes the icon to move right (fixed by removing padding from the hover effect/style the margin instead)
    5. dropbox icon should be 2 lines instead of three (fixed by removing the navbar-toggler-icon class and replacing it with an appropriate image file found on the internet); cite used: https://icons8.com/icons/set/two-lines
    6. hover effect caused other elements beside it to move (fixed by adding a box-shadow instead of a border: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36080415/css-hover-makes-other-elements-move)
    7. post click state leaves border around dropdown (fixed bu making the box shadow of btn focus none)
    8. close button is highlighted when clicked (same fix as 7)

2. Make the Page Footer

# Common Errors and fixes 
    1. add justify-content-end to the class to move things to the complete right of the screen
    2. <hr> is used for underlines
