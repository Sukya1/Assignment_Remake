# Group TO DO's 
1. Make the page Header (progress on the header can be found in the hire talent file)
Bugs:
    1. hover effect causes flickering (fixed by adding transition of 0s/none)
    2. post hoving effect shows a blue rectangle before returning to normal (fixed by adding transition of 0s/none)
    3. contents of the drop box have not yet been modified
    4. hover effect causes the icon to move right (fixed by removing padding from the hover effect/style the margin instead)
    5. dropbox icon should be 2 lines instead of three (fixed by removing the navbar-toggler-icon class and replacing it with an appropriate image file found on the internet)
2. Make the Page Footer
